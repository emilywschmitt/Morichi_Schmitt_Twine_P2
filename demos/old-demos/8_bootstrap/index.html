     <h3>Tasks</h3>
     <ol>
          <li>Return a product.</li>
          <li>Buy groceries for pick up.</li>
          <li>What is on sale/clearance?</li>
          <li>Search and find the biggest television to buy from Walmart.</li>
          <li>Create a baby registry.</li>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      
      <ol>
          <li>Return a product.</li>
          <p>Subject went straight to "Your Account" to view previous orders that have been made but had to "sign in" first in order to access account history. After signing in and clicking on "Your Account" subject went to "Order History" and did not automatically go to "Start a Return." After clicking on "Start a Return" it says to go to "Order History." User was confused on why the "Start a Return" tab said to refer to "Order History." [Time - 3:05]<br>User was successful<br></p>
          <li>Buy groceries for pick up.</li>
          <p>User began to click on food items without clicking on tab to shop for groceries. Subject was observing products that he wanted to buy, but did not notice it was not going into his cart. The next tab the user clicked on was titled "Pick It Up Today." He was confused by its placement because it was placed next to other tabs at the top of the page under the Walmart header, titled "Halloween," "My Local Store Tips & Ideas." User then went to all departments and looked for groceries but eventually found the "Food, Household & Pets." User then clicked on "Grocery Pickup & Delivery." User chose pop tarts and placed one in th cart. User was denied the ability to purchase items because you needed a minimum of $30 before being able to purchase items. User placed 12 boxes of pop tarts in clart then clciked "Checkout." After clicking on "Checkout" another page popped up with similar snacks as pop tarts that stated "Need to fill up your pantry? Here are some staples frequently purchased with orders like yours" to make buyer look one more time at other items they can purshase. User then clicked "Proceed To Checkout" and had to choose a date and time in which they would pick up their groceries. After proceeding, user had to place in form of payment. [Time - 4:35]<br>User was successful</p>
          <li>What is on sale/clearance?</li>
          <p>User clicked on "Shop Walmart Favorites" then clicked back to Walmart's main page. User then went to "All" arrow tab to look for clearance, but did not have it. User began to scroll down and stumbled upon a clearance section. [Time - 0:55]<br>User was successful<br></p>
          <li>Search and find the biggest television to buy from Walmart.</li>
          <p>User typed television into search bar then entered. The nest page that loadde had many categories user could choose from, the first choice was "TVs by Size." After clicking on that tab, TV sizes popped up and the biggest size user could choose was 70" & Larger TVs. The largest TV that can be purchased from Walmart is 78". [Time - 0:44]<br>User was successful<br></p>
          <li>Create a baby registry.</li>
          <p>User went to deaprtment and scrolled to find anything that stated "registry." At the bottom of the department tabs, there were two options to either create a "Baby Registry" or "Wedding Registry." [Time - 0:12]<br>User was successful<br></p>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Was user successful in completing tasks?</h3>
      <p>The user was successful in completing all of the given tasks. There were a few moments of confusion because of the positioning of some tabs.</p>
      
      <h3>What recommendations could you make to the website owner?</h3>
      <p>The only issue I saw was tabs being in certain places that the costumer wasn't expecting. For example, when the costumer went to buy groceries for pick up, the "Pick Up" tab is fairly small and right under the header which can easily be dismissed or skimmed over. I would reccommend it to be under departments or more visible because this is an option that might be used more often than not. Also, the "clearance" tab is under the "department", however clearance is a different color and both the user and I skimmed over it. </p>
      
      <p>Accuracy: How many mistakes did they make and how fast did they recover?
      <br>The user made a total of 6 mistakes and quickly recovered.<br></p>
        <p>Recall: How much do they remember on multiple uses?
        <br>The user rememebred in the "deparments" tab, everything that he (as a costumer) would want would be in there. The user rarely used the search bar until he wanted to find something specific. For example, when he needed to find the "biggest" TV and not TVs in general, he typed in "biggest TV."<br></p>
        <p>Emotional response: How did they person feel about the website?
        <br>The user felt as if the website was fine to use. The only issue was the confusion with tab placement.<br></p>
