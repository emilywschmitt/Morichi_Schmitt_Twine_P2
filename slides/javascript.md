## Introduction

JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behavior on most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run.



## Methods
```javaScript
// Returns a number between 0 and 1
Math.random();
```

Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period ., the method name, and parentheses. <a href="javascript:function run() {alert( Math.random() );} run();">run</a>
